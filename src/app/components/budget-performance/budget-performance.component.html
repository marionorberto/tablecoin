<!-- 
Here’s a wireframe idea for structuring the budget performance page in your financial dashboard, designed to provide clear insights and a visually appealing layout:

### 1. **Header Section**
- **Title:** "Budget Performance Overview"
  - Centered at the top.
  - Large, bold font.
- **Date Range Picker:**
  - Below the title, aligned to the right.
  - Options like "This Year," "This Quarter," "Custom Range."

---

### 2. **Budget vs. Actual Summary**
- **Summary Cards:** A row of 4 cards right below the header.
  - **Card 1:** "Total Budget"
  - **Card 2:** "Actual Spending"
  - **Card 3:** "Variance (Budget vs. Actual)"
  - **Card 4:** "Performance Ratio (Actual/Budget)"
  - Each card should be rectangular, with the main figure prominently displayed, and a color-coded indicator showing performance (e.g., green for under budget, red for over budget).

---

### 3. **Budget Allocation Breakdown**
- **Pie Chart or Donut Chart:**
  - Positioned below the summary cards, taking up about one-third of the page width.
  - Displays how the budget is allocated across different categories (e.g., marketing, operations, salaries).
- **Budget by Category Bar Chart:**
  - Positioned to the right of the pie chart, taking up the remaining two-thirds of the width.
  - A horizontal bar chart comparing budgeted amounts to actual spending for each category, with bars color-coded to show under or over-spending.

---

### 4. **Budget Performance Trends**
- **Line Graph:**
  - Positioned below the Budget Allocation Breakdown section, spanning the full width.
  - Shows trends over time, comparing budgeted vs. actual spending for different periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
  - The graph could be color-coded to highlight periods of significant variance.

---

### 5. **Detailed Budget Performance Table**
- **Table Layout:**
  - Positioned below the line graph, taking up the full width.
  - Columns: Category, Budgeted Amount, Actual Amount, Variance, Performance Ratio.
  - Include sorting options and filters for categories or time periods.
  - Add color-coded indicators for quick visual assessment (e.g., green for within budget, red for over budget).

---

### 6. **Variance Analysis & Insights**
- **Analysis Section:**
  - Positioned below or beside the budget performance table.
  - **Variance Analysis:**
    - A panel that explains the reasons behind significant variances, such as unexpected costs, changes in project scope, or timing differences.
  - **Actionable Insights:**
    - Suggestions or recommendations to address over-spending or optimize budget allocations in the future.

---

### 7. **Scenario Planning Tool**
- **Interactive Tool:**
  - Positioned at the bottom of the page, full-width.
  - Allows users to adjust budget allocations or simulate different spending scenarios to see how they would affect overall budget performance.
  - The tool should update the charts and summary figures in real-time as adjustments are made.

---

### 8. **Footer Section**
- **Export & Reports:**
  - Positioned at the bottom, spanning the full width.
  - Buttons for "Export as PDF," "Download Budget Report," etc.
